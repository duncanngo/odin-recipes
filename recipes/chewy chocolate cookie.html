  <p>Description</p>
  <p>I named it "Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies,” because it’s got everything a cookie connoisseur could possibly ask for. With a texture that is slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, it’s a favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 1/4
        cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1
        teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps</p>
<ul>
    <ol>1. Heat oven to 375°F. In small bowl, mix flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.</ol>
    <ol>2. In large bowl, beat softened butter and sugars with electric mixer on medium speed, or mix with spoon about 1 minute or until fluffy, scraping side of bowl occasionally.</ol>
    <ol>3. Beat in egg and vanilla until smooth. Stir in flour mixture just until blended (dough will be stiff). Stir in chocolate chips and nuts.</ol>
    <ol>4. Onto ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart.</ol>
    <ol>5.Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown (centers will be soft). Cool 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Store covered in airtight container.</ol>
